**Toast Notification System**

This project is a simple and customizable **Toast Notification System** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean and responsive interface to display toast messages, which are lightweight notifications appearing from the top-right corner of the screen. These notifications are commonly used to provide feedback to users for actions such as form submissions, errors, or warnings.

#### Key Features:

1. **Multiple Notification Types**:
   - Success
   - Error
   - Invalid (warning)
2. **Slide-in Animation**:

   - Toast messages smoothly slide down from the top-right corner with a fade effect, providing a modern and appealing user experience.

3. **Auto Dismiss & Manual Dismiss**:

   - Toast messages automatically disappear after 2 seconds.
   - Users can also manually close the toast message by clicking the "X" button.

4. **Dynamic Message Content**:

   - The toast notifications display different icons and messages based on the type (success, error, or warning), ensuring the user can easily understand the context.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The system is designed to work on a wide range of screen sizes, ensuring that the toast messages are appropriately positioned and styled for desktop and mobile views.

#### Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: For the structure of the notification system and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the toast notifications, including layout, colors, and animation effects.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamically creating and handling the behavior of the toast notifications (show, dismiss, animation, etc.).

This system can easily be integrated into any web application that needs non-intrusive, visually appealing feedback to the user without interrupting the overall flow of the app.
